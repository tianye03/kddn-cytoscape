### KDDN app for Cytoscape

KDDN is a Cytoscape app to learn biological network topology and its changes using profiling data and domain knowledge. It takes input data and runs KDDN algorithm to construct the dependency network. When two conditions data are available, KDDN identifies the statistically significant condition-specific edges to provide insights into system dynamics.

A KDDN experiment can be performed following 4 steps:
1. Determine the experiment condition;
2. Provide input data;
3. Choose how you like the model parameters to be specified;
4. Configure running options.
